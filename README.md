# Inspection Lens <img align="right" src="logo.png" alt="Plugin Logo">

Displays errors, warnings, and other inspections inline. Highlights the background of lines with inspections. Supports light and dark themes out of the box.

By default, the plugin shows **Errors**, **Warnings**, **Weak Warnings**, **Server Problems**, **Grammar Errors**, **Typos**, and other inspections with a high enough severity level. Left-click an inspection to show quick fixes. Middle-click an inspection to navigate to the relevant code in the editor.

Configure appearance, behavior of clicking on inspections, and visible severities in **Settings | Tools | Inspection Lens**.
